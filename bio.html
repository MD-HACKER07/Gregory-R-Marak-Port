        <p>Hello! I'm Gregory R Marak, a passionate B.Tech Computer Science Engineering (CSE) student and an aspiring software engineer. I love diving deep into programming, problem-solving, and exploring the world of technology. In addition to my interest in software development, I have a strong background in Python programming, web development, and ethical hacking.</p>
        <p>Currently, I'm pursuing my B.Tech in CSE at Sanjivani College of Engineering. I enjoy exploring new technologies, learning about cryptography, and experimenting with AI to solve real-world problems.</p>
        <p>When I'm not coding or working on projects, I like to read, spend time with my friends, and play with animals. My favorite day is Sunday, which I spend relaxing and reflecting on my work.</p>
